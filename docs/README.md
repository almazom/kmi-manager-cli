# Documentation Notice

The canonical documentation now lives under `docs/`.

Please use:
- `docs/sdd/` for system design docs
- `docs/` for project gathering, review library, and schemas
- `docs/overview_ru.md` for a simplified Russian overview with an ASCII visualization

This `Docs/` directory is kept for legacy references and will be removed in a future cleanup.
