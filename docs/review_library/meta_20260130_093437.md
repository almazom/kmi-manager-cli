# Meta Critic Report
Suggested filename: docs/review_library/meta_20260130_093437.md

I bring 30 years of experience reviewing developer tools, API gateways, and reliability-critical CLI systems across regulated and high-scale environments. Over three decades I have led code review programs, incident audits, and compliance readiness checks where evidence trails and operational reproducibility are mandatory. That background makes me bias toward validating behavior under stress rather than relying on control-flow reading. I focus on whether reviews surface the real-world seams - operator workflows, persistence, and proxy lifecycles - where costly failures tend to hide.

## Blind Spots / Missing Checks / Risks
- No explicit evidence trail: findings do not consistently cite concrete files/paths/tests run, so confidence is hard to assess or reproduce.
- Scope drift risk: reviews do not pin to a commit SHA or release artifact, so future comparisons can silently mix code versions.
- Limited runtime validation: few or no end-to-end runs (proxy + CLI + TUI), so behavior under load, signals, and partial upstream outages remains assumed.
- Over-reliance on code reading: rotation/health logic is inferred without adversarial scenarios (all keys unhealthy, rapid rate limits, corrupted state/trace).
- Dependency and platform gaps: no systematic check of OS portability (Windows locking), packaging/install behavior, or dependency security posture.
- Security/audit posture under-verified: log/trace redaction and file permission handling are mentioned but not validated in actual outputs.

## Process Improvements
- Add an evidence log per review: files inspected, commands run, tests executed (or explicitly skipped with rationale).
- Pin review scope to a commit SHA and date; include "reviewed surfaces" (CLI, proxy, persistence, docs).
- Add scenario-based validation: disk-full, corrupted JSONL, all-keys-unhealthy, burst rate-limits, upstream 5xx.
- Require at least one integration walkthrough covering CLI -> proxy -> trace TUI with realistic traffic.
- Add a dependency/platform checklist: lock behavior on Windows, packaging install path, and basic security scan notes.
