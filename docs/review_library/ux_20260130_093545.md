# UX Seer Report
Suggested filename: docs/review_library/ux_20260130_093545.md

## Intro
I bring 30 years of experience designing and auditing developer tools that live in the terminal and get used under pressure. Over the decades I have learned that tiny friction points in defaults, error recovery, and docs navigation can quietly erode operator trust. I focus on clarity, "what happens next," and the lowest-stress path to a successful first run. That lens guided this UX pass across CLI behavior, error messaging, documentation, and operational ergonomics.

## Scope
- CLI UX (flags, help, flows) in `src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`
- Error messaging and recovery in `src/kmi_manager_cli/errors.py` and `src/kmi_manager_cli/proxy.py`
- Documentation and onboarding in `README.md`, `docs/`, and `Docs/`
- Operator ergonomics in dashboards and trace TUI (`src/kmi_manager_cli/ui.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/trace_tui.py`)

## Strengths
- Mode visibility is consistently surfaced for most commands, reducing accidental live traffic (`src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/proxy.py`).
- Rich dashboards with `--plain`/`--no-color` and `KMI_TIMEZONE`/`KMI_LOCALE` are strong accessibility and locale choices (`src/kmi_manager_cli/ui.py`, `.env.example`).
- Error responses include actionable hints for proxy auth and remediation guidance for exhausted keys (`src/kmi_manager_cli/proxy.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/errors.py`).
- State/trace schema is documented and paths are explicit, which helps operators locate artifacts fast (`README.md`, `docs/state_trace_schema.md`).

## Findings (ordered by impact)
- High: Config validation errors raise uncaught exceptions, causing stack traces instead of user-friendly guidance (e.g., invalid base URL or base path) (`src/kmi_manager_cli/config.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`).
- Medium: Health commands call real upstream usage even while the CLI announces DRY-RUN, which can surprise operators who expect "no network" semantics (`src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/health.py`).
- Medium: Documentation drift and split roots increase onboarding friction; `Docs/` vs `docs/`, plus SDD docs omit current flags (`--health`, `--current`, `--status`) and show inconsistent status labels (`docs/sdd/kmi-rotation-sdd/keyword-detection.md`, `docs/sdd/kmi-rotation-sdd/ui-flow.md`, `Docs/SDD/requirements.md`).
- Medium: "No keys" messaging implies `~/.kimi/config.toml` is a substitute for `_auths/`, but rotation/proxy still require auth files, which can mislead first-time users (`src/kmi_manager_cli/errors.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`).
- Low: Help text is dense and lacks quick examples, so common flows (rotate, health, proxy, trace) are not discoverable at a glance (`src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`, `README.md`).
- Low: Proxy start banner always prints `http://` even when TLS is required, which can miscue remote deployments (`src/kmi_manager_cli/cli.py`, `src/kmi_manager_cli/proxy.py`).

## Recommendations
1. Wrap `load_config()` in a friendly error handler that prints the offending setting, resolved `.env` path, and a short fix hint; consider a `kmi doctor` command for full config diagnostics.
2. Make health behavior explicit: either honor dry-run for health by default or add a `--real`/`--live` flag and update the banner to "DRY-RUN (health still hits /usages)" when applicable.
3. Consolidate documentation under `docs/`, add a deprecation pointer in `Docs/`, and update SDD specs to match current flags and outputs.
4. Tighten "no keys" messaging to clarify that `~/.kimi/config.toml` only affects "current" health, not rotation/proxy, and include all supported auth file extensions.
5. Restructure `--help` into short sections with 2-3 common command examples and a one-line "first run" path (create `_auths`, run `kmi --all`, then `kmi proxy`).
