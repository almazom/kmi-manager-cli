# Meta Review - KMI Manager CLI (2026-01-29)

## Expert Bio
I have 30 years of experience reviewing developer tools, API platforms, and reliability-critical services across regulated and high-scale environments. Over three decades, I have led code review programs, post-incident audits, and compliance assessments for CLI tooling and proxy architectures. My focus is on evidence-driven validation, tracing risks to concrete code paths, and making review processes repeatable and auditable. I have designed and evaluated key-rotation, telemetry, and proxy systems across multiple providers and scale tiers.

## Meta Critique of the Review Process
The review appears to emphasize domain risks and expected behaviors but does not clearly separate verified evidence from inferred assumptions. It lacks a documented validation trail (what was opened, what was executed, and what was observed), which weakens confidence in findings. There is no sign of runtime verification or test execution, so behavioral claims remain largely unvalidated. The process also does not state the precise scope (commit, tag, or build), which makes it hard to reproduce or compare over time.

## Blind Spots and Missing Evidence
- Execution gap: No tests, smoke runs, or CLI command invocations are documented.
- Evidence labeling: Assertions are not tagged as verified vs inferred, so confidence is unclear.
- Proxy safety validation: Binding defaults, auth/allowlist, and request limits are not tested.
- Data safety validation: Redaction, retention, and trace/log content are not inspected with real samples.
- Concurrency behavior: No checks for atomic writes, file locking, or multi-process collisions.
- Failure modes: Upstream errors, timeouts, and partial writes are not exercised.
- Environment scope: OS-specific paths, config precedence, and permissions are not validated.

## Improvements for the Next Review
- Add an Evidence Ledger that records files opened, commands run, and outcomes.
- Run a minimal smoke workflow (key load → rotate → proxy request → trace view) and log outputs.
- Separate “verified,” “inferred,” and “risk hypothesis” sections with confidence tags.
- Define review scope precisely (commit SHA, build version, and date).
- Include a short negative-path test matrix for proxy, rotation, and health endpoints.

## Limitations of This Meta Critique
This critique is based on the provided context and the absence of documented validation steps. No code execution, tests, or runtime traces were performed as part of this meta assessment.
