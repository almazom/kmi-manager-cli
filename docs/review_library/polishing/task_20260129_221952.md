# SSOT Task List - KMI Manager CLI
Generated: 2026-01-29

## High Priority (Critical)
1. Fix 403 handling so temporary policy/rate errors use cooldown instead of permanent block; keep 401 as permanent auth failure. Refs: 🎩 🧟
2. Prevent proxy auth header leakage by stripping `x-kmi-proxy-token` (and other internal proxy auth headers) before forwarding upstream. Refs: 🎩
3. Surface dry-run mode clearly in CLI/help and dashboards to avoid operators mistaking synthetic data for live signals. Refs: 🧙 🎩

## Medium Priority (Important)
4. Add trace/log retention or rotation to prevent unbounded growth and performance degradation in long-running sessions. Refs: 🧹 🧟
5. Raise supported Python version to 3.9+ (3.8 is EOL) and update documentation accordingly. Refs: 🧟
6. Improve onboarding with a runnable quickstart and sample `.env` / `_auths` layout. Refs: 🧙
