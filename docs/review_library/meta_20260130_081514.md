# Meta Critic Review

## Scope
Analyze the review process itself for errors, gaps, or bias. Provide a brief 3–5 sentence description of 30 years of experience. Context: KMI Manager CLI (Python Typer CLI + FastAPI proxy for Kimi API key rotation, local state under ~/.kmi, health scoring, trace TUI, and upstream proxying for /chat/completions, /models, /usages).

## Process Risks, Gaps, and Biases
- **Proxy-centric bias**: Reviews may over-index on API forwarding correctness and ignore local-first operational concerns (state integrity under `~/.kmi`, trace durability, disk growth, and privacy implications). This can miss failure modes that only show up with long-running local logs or corrupted JSONL. 
- **CLI vs. service split**: The dual nature (Typer CLI + FastAPI proxy) can lead to siloed reviews—CLI ergonomics evaluated without validating proxy lifecycle behavior (startup/shutdown, signal handling, concurrency), or API behavior reviewed without the CLI workflows that drive it. This leaves integration risks unexamined.
- **Rotation logic confirmation bias**: Reviewers can assume “rotation works” by reading control flow but fail to challenge scoring heuristics, cooldown windows, and edge cases (all keys unhealthy, partial outages, or oscillation between keys). Without explicit adversarial test cases, the review can be overly optimistic.
- **Observability gap**: A review may focus on feature completeness and miss operational telemetry quality (trace semantics, error classification, redaction). For a local-first tool, observability is the product—if traces are misleading, the tool fails its core purpose.
- **Test coverage skew**: Standard unit tests might be emphasized over realistic integration tests (simulated upstream errors, rate limits, retries, timeouts, and concurrent requests). This bias leads to green tests but fragile field behavior.
- **Operator workflow blind spots**: Reviews that prioritize developer experience can under-weight operator workflows (safe rotation controls, auditability, rollback of health scores, and TUI usability under large traces). This gap surfaces only in production-like usage.

## Review Process Improvements
- Add **scenario-based reviews**: “All keys unhealthy,” “rate-limited bursts,” “partial upstream outage,” “corrupted JSONL” and “disk full” must be walked end-to-end through CLI + proxy.
- Require **trace semantics checks**: Validate redaction rules, timestamps, error taxonomy, and linkability of requests to rotations.
- Conduct **integration walkthroughs**: One reviewer follows the CLI workflow; another validates the API lifecycle and concurrency, then reconcile.
- Incorporate **operational checklists**: file system growth, crash recovery, and safe defaults for sensitive data.

## 30-Year Experience Summary (3–5 sentences)
I’ve spent 30 years building and reviewing developer tools and distributed systems, from early on-prem services to modern API platforms. That range gives me a bias for operational reality: how a system behaves under stress, partial failure, and ambiguous telemetry. I focus on the seams—where human workflows, automation, and system state collide—because that’s where the most expensive bugs hide. My reviews aim to turn “looks correct” into “behaves correctly,” especially when the tool becomes part of someone’s daily operational muscle memory.
