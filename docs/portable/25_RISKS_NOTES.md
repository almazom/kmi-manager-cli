# Risks and Notes

- Auto‑rotation and key pooling may violate provider ToS. Use only if allowed.
- Auth files and logs are plaintext. Protect file permissions on shared machines.
- Remote proxy requires TLS + token. Avoid exposing proxy without protection.
- Trace/log files can grow large; set rotation limits.
